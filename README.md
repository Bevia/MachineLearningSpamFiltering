2. **scikit-learn**:

pip install scikit-learn 

Scikit-learn (also known as sklearn) is a popular open-source machine learning library for Python. 
It provides simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis, and it’s built on top of NumPy, 
SciPy, and matplotlib. Scikit-learn offers a wide range of algorithms for classification, regression, 
clustering, dimensionality reduction, model selection, and preprocessing.
Key Features of Scikit-learn:

	•	Simple and Efficient Tools: Designed for easy use and performance.
	•	Broad Range of Algorithms: Includes support for popular algorithms like support vector machines (SVM), 
random forests, k-nearest neighbors, k-means clustering, and more.
	•	Consistent API: Offers a uniform interface across all methods, making it easier to switch between models.
	•	Integration with Other Libraries: Works well with other Python libraries like pandas 
for data manipulation and matplotlib for plotting.
